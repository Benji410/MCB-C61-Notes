\maketitle

Hello! My name is Benjamin Lee and these are my notes for MCB C61, Brain, Mind and Behavior with Professor David Presti. These notes are based off David Presti's textbook \textit{Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience: A Brain-Mind Odyssey}. I include the key concepts that Presti highlights in the textbook as well as additional content related to the topic. I hope these notes will help you understand the concepts of the course. Enjoy!
